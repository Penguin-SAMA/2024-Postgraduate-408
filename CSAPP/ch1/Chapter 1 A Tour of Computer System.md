## 1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms

-   The individual C statements must be translated by other programs into a sequence of low-lecel *machine-language* instructions.

-   On a Unix system, the translation from source file to object file is performed by a compiler driver:

```shell
linux> gcc -o hello hello.c
```

***preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker*** are known collectively as the compilation system.

-   **Preprocessing phase.** The preprocessor modifies the original C program according to directives that begin with the `#` character. The result is another C program, typically with the `.i` suffix.
-   **Compilation phase.** The compiler translates the text file `hello.i` into the text file `hello.s`, which contains an *assmbly-language program*.
-   **Assembly phase. **The assembler translates `hello.s` into machine-language instructions, packages them in a form known as a *relocatable object program*, and stores the result in the object file `hello.o`. 
-   **Linking phase.** Lingking is the process of combining object files and libraries into a single executable file or library in C programming. In `hello` program, Lingker links `printf.o` and `hello.o`. 

## 1.3 It Pays to Understand How Compilation Systems Work

-   ***Optimizing program performance.*** 
-   ***Understanding link-time errors.*** 
-   ***Avoiding security heles.*** 

## 1.4 Processors Read and Interpret Instructions Stored in Memory

### 1.4.1 Hardware Organization of a System

#### Buses

Running throughout the system is a collection of electrical conduits called *buses* that carry bytes of information back and forth between the components. 

Buses are typically designed to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes known as *words*.

*word size* : The number of bytes in a word, is a fundamental system parameter that varies across systems.

#### I/O Devices

**Input/output(I/O)** devices are the systemâ€™s connection to the external world. 

Each I/O device is connected to the I/O bus by either a *controller* or an *adapter*. 

#### Main Memory

The *main memory* is a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while the processor is executing the program.

Physically, main memory consists of a collection of *dynamic random access memory*(DRAM) chips.

Logically, memory is organized as a linear array of bytes, each with its own unique address starting at zero. 

#### Processor

The *center processing unit*(CPU), or simply *processor*, is the engine that interprets (or *executes*) instructions stored in main memory. 

At its core is a word-size storage device (or *register*) called the *program counter* (PC).
